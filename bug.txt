ORG model use cases:
	1. An organization can make bulk payment(salary credit to all the users under the org).
	2. A Payroll report can be generated for a particular org / sub org each month for tax related audit.
	3. Admin can view the users, accounts and transactions on their org.  

MOM:
	1. Instead of sub-orgs push the modules (Fixed Deposit, Loan) in deals modules and the sub org data in leads module.
	2. Instead of single request each time make a bulk write, enqueue in a queue separate for the operations executed by a scheduler.
	3. Handle the concurrency issue with a check in the insert queue.
	4. Updates such as Email or phone number must reflect on the records on the CRM.
	5. Change in the Owner of Accounts module (Org) must be handled.

TODO before the last MOM:
	1. Audit failed call and retry once the conn is available.
	2. Bulk write updates.
	
MOM:
         1. Instead of get call for every put or post request map the Record ID with a primary key of a module in cache. 
         2. Validate the phone number(E164 Format) and email via otp, using the google lib and LLM for spam detection and update the status in CRM according to the score generated.
         3. Audit the failed Calls and retry once the connection is available.
         4. Implement Bulk API for updates.
         5. Push modules on different portals and the update should reflect across portals.


1. We can even avoid the 6 fetch by looking into the cache primary key -> recordId
2. Bulk write

{
	Module_Code: 5,
	UseCase: 2,
	Module_Record_Id: 103141312,
	Update Fields: {
		Phone: +9176824332
	}
}

1. update bulk.
2. LLM and phone validation.
3. test failed request.
4. insert sorted set.
5. Atlast multi portal push.	

1. add to db
2. if there are server issue dont remove from sorted set
3. check db using schedular and update only the due to data failed requests..
